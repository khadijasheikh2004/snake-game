## Game Overview

In this game, you control a snake that moves around a grid-based environment, consuming apples to grow longer. The challenge increases as the snake grows and more obstacles appear. The game ends when the snake hits an obstacle, wall, or itself.

Before the game starts, players enter their name. Their score is then recorded and saved, allowing players to compete for high scores even after closing the game.
